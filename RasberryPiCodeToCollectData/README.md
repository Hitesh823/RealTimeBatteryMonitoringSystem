This is a Python code that reads data from three sensors: a voltage sensor, a current sensor, and a temperature sensor. The code is using an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) called ADS1115, which is connected to a Raspberry Pi via the I2C bus.

The code first sets up the ADC and creates objects to represent the input channels for the sensors. It also sets up some calibration parameters for the sensors.

Then, the code creates a CSV file to store the sensor data and writes the headers for the data columns.

The main loop of the code reads the sensor values continuously. It first reads the voltage value and calculates the state of charge (SOC) based on the voltage value. Then, it reads the current value and calculates the average current over a certain number of samples. Finally, it reads the temperature value and calculates the average temperature over a certain number of samples.

The code then prints the sensor values and writes them to the CSV file. It waits for 1 second and repeats the loop.

Overall, this code can be used to monitor the voltage, current, temperature, and state of charge of a battery or other electrical system. The data can be stored in a CSV file for later analysis.
