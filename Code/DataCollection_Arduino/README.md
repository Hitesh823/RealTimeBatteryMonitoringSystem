The code is written for an Arduino board that measures and displays data related to a battery. The three sensors used in the code are a current sensor, a voltage sensor, and a temperature sensor. These sensors are connected to the analog input pins of the Arduino board.

The code begins with defining the pin numbers for each sensor and the resistor values for the voltage divider circuit. It also defines a reference voltage for the analog-to-digital converter.

In the setup function, the code initiates communication with the Serial Monitor, which is a tool that allows the user to view data in real-time. It also prints a message to indicate that the sensor is ready to measure.

The main part of the code is in the loop function, which repeats continuously until the board is powered off. The loop function first calculates the average current by measuring the voltage across the current sensor and converting it into current using the Ohm's Law equation. It takes 25 samples of the current, adds them up, and calculates the average value.

Next, it measures the voltage of the battery using a voltage divider circuit, and calculates the state of charge (SOC) based on the voltage level. It then measures the temperature of the battery using a thermistor connected to an analog pin, and calculates the temperature in degrees Celsius.

Finally, the code prints the values of current, voltage, SOC, and temperature to the Serial Monitor. The values are printed with a delay of 5 seconds between each reading.
