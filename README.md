# Real Time Battery Monitoring System using Machine Learning
* This project aims to build a real-time battery monitoring system that uses machine learning to predict the remaining lifetime of a battery. 


** A real-time battery monitoring system is a system that uses sensors and machine learning algorithms to continuously monitor the performance of a battery. The system measures key parameters such as the battery's current, voltage, and temperature, and uses this information to predict its remaining charge and overall health. The predictions are output in real-time, allowing the user to monitor the battery's performance and take appropriate actions if needed. This type of system is often used in applications where the battery's performance is critical, such as in electric vehicles or renewable energy systems.
