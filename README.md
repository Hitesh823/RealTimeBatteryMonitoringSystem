# Battery Management System (BMS) Project

This repository contains code and scripts related to our Battery Management System (BMS) project, which includes data collection, real-time prediction, and monitoring. 

## Project Overview

Our BMS project aims to streamline battery management by leveraging simple sensors and machine learning. It consists of three main components:

- **ArduinoCodeToFCollectData:** This folder contains Arduino code for collecting battery data.

- **BMS/RealTimePredictionScripts:** Here, you'll find scripts for real-time battery health prediction.

- **RasberryPiCodeToCollectData:** Raspberry Pi code for data collection is stored in this folder.
