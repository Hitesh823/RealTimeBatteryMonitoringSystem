## Introduction

In this project, we explore a machine learning-driven prediction approach, leveraging the power of **XGBoost** as our algorithm of choice. The methodology involved meticulous problem identification, complemented by robust statistical analysis to validate our outcomes. We constructed a resilient **Battery Management System (BMS) module**, integrating diverse software and hardware components. The module collected real-world data from a quadcopter, establishing a comprehensive training dataset for **predicting State of Charge (SoC)**.

To enhance realism, we introduced three types of noise and evaluated the model's performance under distinct charging conditions. The results were promising, revealing nuanced behavior: as battery charging levels decreased, prediction errors increased to a certain extent, introducing inaccuracies. Notably, our model showcased heightened accuracy at higher charging levels.

While our findings indicate substantial potential for refining model parameters to achieve optimal accuracy across all charging levels, our current results mark a significant step forward in **machine learning-based battery prediction.**

## Code Structure
The Code folder contains three sub-folders:

- **DataCollection_Arduino**: Arduino codes for collecting data (current, voltage, temperature, SOC) and a combined sensor data collection script.

- **Notebook**: Python scripts for machine learning algorithms, preprocessing, and analysis.

- **RealTimePredictionScripts**: Python scripts for real-time BMS predictions, including data logging, preprocessing, machine learning model execution, and script execution.
