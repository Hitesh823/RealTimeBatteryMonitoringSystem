# RealTimeBatteryMonitoringSystem
Implementation of research papers with the goal of improving the existing system for monitoring batteries using machine learning and deep learning techniques
           The ANN, Linear Regression for Multi Variables, SVM, and Random Forest Algorithms were all put through their paces, and the ANN trained model came out on top with an accuracy of 96.25percentage for the State of charge estimation
